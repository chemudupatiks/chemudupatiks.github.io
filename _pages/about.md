Hi, I am Krishna. I am a first year Masters student in Computer Science at the University of Colorado, Boulder.

Before this, I graduated with my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Wyoming. My research at <a href="https://mallet.ai" target="blank">Mallet Lab</a> at the University of Wyoming involved exploring scenarios where Algorithm selection systems performed poorly to leverage that information and improve such systems in practice. 

<!-- **I am currently looking for summer internship opportunities for the roles of Machine Learning Engineer. Please find link to my resume here.** -->

I am proficient in Python, C++, and Java. Please view the projects tab to see all the projects I have worked on. Also, here is a link to my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chemudupatiks" target="blank">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://www.github.com/chemudupatiks" target="blank">GitHub</a>.
